<p>TRUE! – nervous – very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses – not destroyed – not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute.</p>
<p><em>MC stands up. PC1 takes chair and passes it to PC2,3, who move it to the side of the stage. PC1 also moves to the back.</em></p>
<p>I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad?</p>

<section id="scene-2-build-up" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scene-2-build-up">Scene 2: Build-up</h2>
<p>It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object there was none. Passion there was none. I loved the old man. He had never wronged me. He had never given me insult. For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! yes, it was this! He had the eye of a vulture – a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees – very gradually – I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.</p>
<p><em>matter of fact, calmer to prove that MC is totally not mad</em></p>
<p><em>PC also move into a neutral posture</em></p>
<p>Now this is the point. You fancy me mad.</p>
<p><em>suddently angry</em></p>
<p>Madmen know nothing.</p>
<p><em>PC move to the back as if pushed away by the anger, movement starts from the middle of the body</em></p>
<p>But you should have seen me. You should have seen how wisely I proceeded – with what caution – with what foresight – with what dissimulation I went to work!</p>
<p>I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him.</p>
<p><em>PC2 as old man enters from the back and stumbles, PC3 catches them. PC1 follows close behind.</em> <em>PC2,3 move to the side of the stage, PC1 stays further back.</em> <em>PC move around in slow motion</em> <em>PC2,3 mime opening the door and moving their heads towards the middle, symmetrical, in sync</em></p>
<p>And every night, about midnight, I turned the latch of his door and opened it – oh so gently! And then, when I had made an opening sufficient for my head, I put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, so that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. Oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly I thrust it in!</p>
<p><em>PC1 moves between PC2,3 with an imaginary lantern stretched out in front</em></p>
<p>I moved it slowly – very, very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man’s sleep. It took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed. Ha!</p>
<p><em>PC in neutral</em></p>
<p>– would a madman have been so wise as this?</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>No!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>PC1 turns around crouches down</em> <em>PC2 lies down on the floor, feet in the middle of the PC spot. PC3 moves to their shoulders, crouching.</em></p>
<p>And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously – oh, so cautiously. I undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye.</p>
<p><em>PC1 holds PC2s feet, PC3 lifts PC2 by their sholders into an upright position</em> <em>Spotlight onto PC2, no mask, eyes closed.</em></p>
<p>And this I did for seven long nights – every night just at midnight – but I found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his Evil Eye.</p>
<p><em>PC intro neutral. walk to the back.</em></p>
<p><em>PC2,3 take two steps from the back and do a ballet-jump curtsy, holding the position for the next paragraph</em></p>
<p>And every morning, when the day broke, I went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he has passed the night. So you see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, I looked in upon him while he slept.</p>
</section>
<section id="scene-3-the-8th-night" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scene-3-the-8th-night">Scene 3: The 8th night</h2>
<p><em>PC2,3 unfreeze from curtsy and repeat the door opening and peaking, slower as before</em></p>
<p><em>PC1 in the middle again with the lantern</em></p>
<p>Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. A watch’s minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. Never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers – of my sagacity. I could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. To think that there I was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. I fairly chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled. Now you may think that I drew back – but no. His room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness and so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and I kept pushing it on steadily, steadily.</p>
<p>I had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in bed, crying out –</p>
<p><em>PC into neutral</em></p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Who’s there?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I kept quite still and said nothing. For a whole hour I did not move a muscle, and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down. He was still sitting up in the bed listening; – just as I have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall.</p>
<p>Presently I heard a slight groan, and I knew it was the groan of mortal terror.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p><em>Groan, terrifying sounds. inhaling?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was not a groan of pain or of grief – oh, no! – it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe. I knew the sound well.</p>
<p><em>PC with haunting movements, in sync with imperceivable heartbeat sound</em></p>
<p>Many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me.</p>
<p>When I had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie down, I resolved to open a little – a very, very little crevice in the lantern. So I opened it – you cannot imagine how stealthily, stealthily – until, at length a single dim ray, like the thread of the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell full upon the vulture eye.</p>
<p><em>Same “bed” spotlight setup as before, mask off, eyes now wide open.</em></p>
<p>It was open – wide, wide open – and I grew furious as I gazed upon it. I saw it with perfect distinctness –all a dull blue, with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but I could see nothing else of the old man’s face or person: for I had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot.</p>
<p>And have I not told you that what you mistake for madness is but over acuteness of the senses? – now, I say, there came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton.</p>
<p><em>Heartbeat sound, very slow, quiet</em></p>
<p><em>PC start lightly clapping their hands on the sides of their bodies as a heartbeat</em></p>
<p>I knew that sound ell, too. It was the beating of the old man’s heart. It increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage.</p>
<p><em>Heartbeat sound intensifies, slightly faster, louder</em></p>
<p><em>PC move around frantically, angry, in sync with the heartbeat sound</em></p>
<p><em>PC re-enact the words of MC</em></p>
<p>The old man’s hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern and leaped into the room. He shrieked once – once only. In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him.</p>
<p><em>PC bang their fists on the floor for the heartbeat sound</em></p>
<p>I then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done. But, for many minutes, the heart beat on with a muffled sound. This, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard through the wall. At length it ceased.</p>
<p><em>Heartbeat sound stops</em> <em>PC fade into the background</em></p>
<p>The old man was dead. I removed the bed and examined the corpse. Yes, he was stone, stone dead. I placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes. There was no pulsation. He was stone dead. His eye would trouble me no more.</p>
</section>
<section id="scene-4-hiding-the-body" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scene-4-hiding-the-body">Scene 4: Hiding the body</h2>
<p><em>PC line up diagonally from the back right towards the position of MC on the front left. They form a “disassembly” line to mime the words of MC, passing body parts from the back to the front. PC3: saw, PC2: hatchet, hammer, PC1: floor boards.</em></p>
<p>If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body. The night waned, and I worked hastily, but in silence. First of all I dismembered the corpse. I cut off the head and the arms and the legs.</p>
<p>I then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye – not even his –could have detected any thing wrong. There was nothing to wash out – no stain of any kind – no blood-spot whatever. I had been too wary for that. A tub had caught all – ha! ha!</p>
<p><em>PC2,3 move to the back. PC1 moves to the side</em></p>
<p>When I had made an end of these labors, it was four o’clock – still dark as midnight.</p>
<p><em>PC2,3 step onto stage, knock on their chests, twice like the hearbat</em></p>
<p>As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door. I went down to open it with a light heart, – for what had I now to fear? There entered two men, who introduced themselves, with perfect suavity, as officers of the police. A shriek had been heard by a neighbor during the night; suspicion of foul play had been aroused; information had been lodged at the police office, and they (the officers) had been deputed to search the premises.</p>
<p><em>PC1 leads PC2,3 onto stage, showing them around 3 positions. Ends with taking the chair from the side and putting it in its original spot in the MC spot</em></p>
<p>I smiled, – for what had I to fear? I bade the gentlemen welcome. The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was absent in the country. I took my visitors all over the house. I bade them search – search well. I led them, at length, to his chamber. I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm of my confidence, I brought chairs into the room, and desired them here to rest from their fatigues, while I myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse.</p>
<p><em>PC in neutral, start heartbeat</em> <em>Heartbeat sound starts again, quietly</em></p>
</section>
<section id="scene-5-finale" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scene-5-finale">Scene 5: Finale</h2>
<p>The officers were satisfied. My manner had convinced them. I was singularly at ease. They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they chatted of familiar things. But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and wished them gone. My head ached, and I fancied a ringing in my ears: but still they sat and still chatted. The ringing became more distinct: – it continued and became more distinct: I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling: but it continued and gained definiteness – until, at length, I found that the noise was not within my ears.</p>
<p>No doubt I now grew very pale; – but I talked more fluently, and with a heightened voice. Yet the sound increased – and what could I do? It was a low, dull, quick sound – much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton.</p>
<p><em>Heartbeat sound gets louder, PC vary the movements to generate the sound</em></p>
<p>I gasped for breath – and yet the officers heard it not. I talked more quickly – more vehemently; but the noise steadily increased. I arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased.</p>
<p>Why would they not be gone? I paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the observations of the men – but the noise steadily increased. Oh God! what could I do? I foamed – I raved – I swore! I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased. It grew louder – louder – louder! And still the men chatted pleasantly, and smiled. Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God! – no, no! They heard! – they suspected! – they knew! – they were making a mockery of my horror! – this I thought, and this I think. But anything was better than this agony! Anything was more tolerable than this derision! I could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer! I felt that I must scream or die! – and now – again! – hark!</p>
<p>louder! louder! louder! louder!</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>louder! louder! louder! louder!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Villains! Dissemble no more! I admit the deed! – tear up the planks! – here, here! – it is the beating of his hideous heart!</p>
<p><em>PC2,3 step forward as police officers, grab MC, sit them back onto the chair (repeat of opening). PC1 fades backwards. Lights off.</em></p>
<p><em>Heartbeat sound stops</em></p>
